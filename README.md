# Control-Panel
Django website in which you are able to add people, wether they are friends of you or not and to make comments about them all stored in the database. 

TODO List:

- Add editing people function (only friend checkmark with also JS that enables/disables the button if the checkmark is checked or not)
- Add deleting people function - Done
- Better Frontend - Done
- Destory API and make direct requests to database - Done
- Add SSO
- Add "export data" function
- Add Favicon
- Change font to Cera Pro (cooler)


Feel free to make a pull request and to edit the TODO list if you want any other function. The repository is NOT meant for production, I always use it in localhost and always will.

Ps. I'm aware it is not responsive, it is only meant for my PC so if you want to create a control panel for yourself you also need to know a bit of frontending.
